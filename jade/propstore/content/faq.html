                        Was this piece really held by my favorite actor?

                        <p class="p-s">The filmmaking process requires that multiples be made of all principal props and costumes. This is standard practice for a variety of production and continuity reasons. First and foremost, filmmaking is an expensive process, and a production cannot risk unnecessary delays due to having the only version of a prop or costume damaged on set, so they will always have back-ups in place. Multiple versions may also be required for continuity purposes. For instance, a particular garment may need to be distressed as the story progresses. To that end, different versions of that garment will exist so that it can be filmed out of sequence and the story's continuity will remain in-tact once the film is edited and put together.</p>
                        <p class="p-s">Props are frequently made in a variety of different versions. There is typically a hero or beauty prop for close up shots. These tend to be made of better materials, whereas lightweight versions will also be made for stunt and safety work that typically don't need to hold up to close visual scrutiny. In other cases, props may need to have functionality to them. These special effects props can have moving parts (i.e., a retractable blade for a "stabbing" sword or knife) or even working lights.</p>
                        <p class="p-s">Different takes of the same scene may also utilize multiple different examples of a prop or costume, meaning a piece could have been shot but still not make it to the final cut.</p>
                        <p class="p-s">Because of the fact that pieces are almost always used in multiples during a production, it is not always possible to guarantee a particular item is the one seen in the final cut of a film or show. All of the items in Prop Store's inventory are guaranteed to be originals from the production, unless otherwise stated. In some cases it may be possible to provide further evidence about the use of an individual item based on matching "tells" on the item to what's on screen, or based on other relevant information. When this is the case, Prop Store will include that information in the description.</p>

                        What is a storyboard?

                        <p class="p-s">A storyboard is a filmmaking tool productions use to pre-visualise scenes shot by shot. It starts with a pen and ink or pencil original drawn by a storyboard artist under the guidance of the director. Once completed, it is copied for each Head of Department for their reference. Copies are created as part of the filmmaking process and those copies are still original production-used pieces. Every storyboard drawing is usually accompanied by the number of the shot in the sequence of the story, a small description and the characters involved, arrows indicating the direction of the action or camera, and any special requirements or effects.</p>
                        <p class="p-s">Each board shows a carefully crafted image which represents the desired view through the camera lens - essentially what the audience will see. The volume of storyboards varies from production to production, with some directors choosing to storyboard each and every shot and others only detailing visual effects sequences. The shots in visual effects work must be planned very carefully due to the high cost associated with creating each shot.</p>
                        <p class="p-s">Customers can rest assured that all storyboards listed by the Prop Store are guaranteed to be genuine production-used originals. Prop Store does not manufacture new storyboard copies, we only sell original paperwork used during the production of the movie.</p>
