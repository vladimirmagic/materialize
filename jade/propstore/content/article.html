            <p class="p-l article__paragraph">The "Carry On" movies are quintessentially British comedies with enduring appeal. Starting back in 1958 with "Carry On Sergeant" and running through to "Carry On Columbus" in 1992, the film series has spanned over 60 years with 31 movies. This gives the films the distinction of being the longest continuous British film series to date.</p>
            <p class="p-r article__paragraph">Although each film in the franchise had its own stories and characters, there was a regular ensemble cast who created a continuity of sorts throughout the series. The regular cast members included British comedy stalwarts of the 20th century such as Hattie Jacques (who was always the matron, or some other bossy authority figure)? Frankie Howerd (whose modest delivery belied his comic genius) Kenneth Williams (who was usually hapless and put-upon)? Sid James (usually a conman or crook) and Barbara Windsor (who provided the cheeky "glamour").</p>
            <p class="p-r article__paragraph">The film series was also made popular through its use of a number of broad popular movie "themes" - occupational films (Carry on Sergeant, Nurse, Doctor etc), historical themes (including Carry on Cleo, Henry, Up The Khyber) and also a number of pastiches of contemporary movies (such as Carry on Screaming (a Hammer Horror spoof) and Carry On Spying (a James Bond spoof).</p>

            <p class="p-r article__paragraph">The films were always made at Pinewood Studios on a very tight budget. The first film cost around &pound;73,000 (approximately &pound;1.6 million in today's terms) which is how they managed to be consistently profitable throughout their run. Indeed, one fun fact is that Carry On Cleo (a spoof on the mega-budget Taylor/Burton epic) only looked so authentic because they managed to get access to use some of the sets from the actual film Cleopatra - which was, at the time, the most expensive film ever made.</p>
            <p class="p-r article__paragraph">The franchise was led throughtout by the same team, viz. Gerald Thomas (Director) and Peter Thomas (Producer), supported by mane regular writers and crew. Such was the popularity of Carry On that is spawned other produts during its heyday, including 4 Christmas "specials" between 1969 and 1973, a TV series with 13 episodes in 1975, and a theatrical spin-off that played in the West End and throughout the UK.</p>

            <p class="p-r article__paragraph">This early "Carry On Constable" poster is a US Half-Sheet with the usual cheeky charm of the Carry On series. From the fourth film in the series, this poster highlights one of the films starring moments - the first nudity scene in the series! Interestingly, the US poster version shown here has a far cheekier layout than the corresponding British poster formats!</p>
