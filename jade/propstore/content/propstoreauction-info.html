        content="Google Calendar ReminderOutlook Calendar Reminder This lot will be auctioned on Tuesday, June 21st. The auction will begin at 8:00am PDT and lots are sold sequentially via live auctioneer; tune in to the live streaming broadcast on auction day to follow the pace. Note other lots in the auction may close on Wednesday, June 22nd; Thursday, June 23rd; or Friday, June 24th. Doc Brown&#39;s (Christopher Lloyd) screen-matched SFX wind-up Cadillac from Robert Zemeckis&#39; sci-fi film Back to the Future. While demonstrating a plan to send Marty (Michael J. Fox) back to the future, Doc Brown accidentally set his model car on fire. This pressed steel wind-up toy was modeled after a 1950s-era Cadillac and was modified by production to suit the needs of the scene. A wire was added to the trunk to simulate the rod the DeLorean needed to capture the power of the lightning strike. This wire fastens to the car via an attached wooden dowel. On the underside of the car, a black wire has been attached via hot glue and the car can be screen-matched via this wire as well as a piece of tape. Though deliberately burned by production, the interior of the car still retains wires and material used to ignite the fire for the sequence. The vehicle exhibits intentional wear from production use.
