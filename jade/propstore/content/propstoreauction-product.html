<p><strong>4. At the Auction </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>4.1. Estimates</strong></p>

If the Buyer requests Prop Store to apply for an export licence on his or her behalf, Prop Store shall be entitled to make a charge and be paid for this service. Prop Store shall not be obliged to rescind or cancel a sale nor to refund any monies paid by the Buyer to Prop Store as a result of or related to the Buyer&rsquo;s failure or inability to obtain an export license.<br />

<p>&nbsp;10.1. Prop Store warrants the attribution of each Lot as stated in the title block (film title and item title) of that Lot in the Auction catalogue, subject to any revisions (which may be given in writing or online before or during the Auction at which the Lot is purchased by the Buyer); this is Prop Store&#39;s Guarantee of Attribution. Buyers should be aware that multiple examples of props and costumes are frequently used during production and it is often impossible to determine whether a specific piece has been used on-camera. Any specific on-camera usage known to Prop Store will be noted within the description, but no warranties are given by Prop Store on that description.<br />
&nbsp;10.2. If a Buyer demonstrates, to Prop Store&rsquo;s reasonable satisfaction, that the Guarantee of Attribution is materially incorrect, the sale will be rescinded if the Lot is returned to Prop Store in the same condition in which it was at the time of sale. In order to satisfy Prop Store that the Guarantee of Attribution is materially incorrect, Prop Store reserves the right to require the Buyer to obtain, at the Buyer&rsquo;s expense, the opinion of two experts in the field, mutually acceptable to Prop Store and the Buyer.<br />
&nbsp;10.3. In the event a sale is rescinded in accordance with condition 10.2, Prop Store shall repay to the Buyer the Purchase Price. Repayment of the Purchase Price shall be the Buyer&rsquo;s sole remedy for an incorrect Guarantee of Attribution, to the exclusion of all other remedies to the extent permissible at law. It is specifically understood that this will be considered the Buyer&rsquo;s sole remedy under this clause 10.<br />
&nbsp;10.4. The Buyer expressly agrees that Prop Store shall not be liable in whole or in part, for, and the Buyer shall not be entitled to recover, any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages including loss of profits or value of investment or opportunity cost.<br />
&nbsp;10.5. Bidders are aware that description revisions may occur on some Lots, and should inquire before the Auction whether any description revisions have occurred on a given Lot and/or examine a lot before bidding on it. Prop Store will make all reasonable efforts to make description revisions readily available during the Auction.<br />
&nbsp;10.6. Except as expressly provided in these Conditions Prop Store shall have no liability to the Buyer in respect of a Lot and all and any implied warranties and conditions are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>11. Intellectual property rights </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;11.1. The copyright in all images, illustrations and written material produced by or for Prop Store relating to a Lot (including the contents of the Auction catalogue), is and shall remain at all times the property of Prop Store and shall not be used by the Buyer, nor by anyone else, without Prop Store&rsquo;s written consent. Prop Store and the Seller make no representation or warranty that the Buyer of a Lot will acquire any copyright or other reproduction rights in it.<br />
&nbsp;11.2. In the catalogue descriptions, Prop Store takes steps to identify and provide provenance for Lots offered at auction.

Prop Store in no way claims any connection to or relationship with the producers of the motion picture or other programme. In all cases, the use of the titles or other elements of a motion picture or other programme is for informational purposes only.</p>

Prop Store&rsquo;s obligations shall be suspended and time for performance extended until such time as the event outside it&rsquo;s control is over, following which a new collection or shipping date can be agreed.</p>

<p><strong>13. Other important terms </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;13.1. If any part of these Conditions is found by any court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that part shall be discounted and the rest of the Conditions shall continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.<br />
&nbsp;13.2. The contract is between the Seller, Buyer and Prop Store and no other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.<br />
&nbsp;13.3. If Prop Store fails to insist on performance of any of a Buyer&rsquo;s obligations under these Conditions, or if it delays in doing so, that will not mean that Prop Store has waived its rights against the Buyer and does not mean the Buyer no longer has to comply with those obligations.<br />
&nbsp;13.4. These Conditions are governed by English law, without regard to its choice of law provisions. The Parties agree that any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with this agreement or its subject matter or formation may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction located in England or Wales or, alternatively, in any court of competent jurisdiction where Prop Store or the Bidder/Buyer resides, at the option of the Party bringing the claim, only. The Parties expressly agree to the jurisdiction of such courts and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. The prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of all attorneys&rsquo; fees, costs and expenses incurred by it/him/her in connection with the dispute. &ldquo;Attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses&rdquo; includes, without limitation, paralegals&rsquo; fees and expenses, attorneys&rsquo; consultants&rsquo; fees and expenses, expert witness&rsquo; fees and expenses, and all other expenses incurred by the prevailing party or its attorneys in the course of their representation of the prevailing party in anticipation of and/or during the course of the litigation, whether or not otherwise recoverable as &ldquo;attorneys&rsquo; fees&rdquo; or as &ldquo;costs&rdquo; under applicable law; and the same may be sought and awarded in accordance with applicable procedure as pertaining to an award of contractual attorneys&rsquo; fees.<br />
&nbsp;13.5 By registering for this auction, the supplied card will automatically have a sum of &pound;0.01 held and subsequently returned within 30 working days to verify the validity of the card.<br />
&nbsp;13.6 The buyer is solely responsible for ascertaining that each lot sold with copyright is otherwise cleared for publication including but not limited to satisfying any publicity right that persons appearing in an image may have under any statute or common law. Neither the consignor nor Prop Store Ltd makes any representation or warranty as to any matters that need to be cleared prior to publication. No representation or warranty is made regarding copyright outside of the United Kingdom. All publication issues should be referred to the buyer&rsquo;s own professional advisors. All representations or warranties as to copyright or rights to publish are solely made by the consignor and not Prop Store Ltd; the buyer agrees that Prop Store Ltd. will not be liable to Buyer in any respect for alleged breach of any such representation or warranty.</p>

        <p>The Reserve Price is the minimum price the Seller will accept for a Lot.
        The Reserve Price will not be more than the lowest estimate given by Propstore.
        Please increase your bid to ensure it is above the reserve.</p>
    </div>
    <div id='dropdown-bids-placed' class='dropdown-content dropdown-currency'>
        <p>Bids placed now are max bids which will be executed on your behalf once the auction starts.
        These bids will be executed at the lowest possible price during the auction, as dictated by other bidding activity.
        Please follow the auction closely as most bidding activity occurs while the lot is closing - should you be outbid, you will be able to increase your bid at any point until the lot is sold.</p>
